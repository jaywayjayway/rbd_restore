# NOTES
# This utility assumes one copy of all object files needed to construct the rbd
# are located in the present working direcory at the time of execution.  
# For example all the rb.0.1032.5e69c215.* files.
#
# When listing the "RBD_SIZE_IN_BYTES", be sure you list the full potential size, 
# not just what it appears to be. If you do not know the true size of the rbd,
# you can input a size in bytes that you know is larger than the disk could be
# and it will be a large sparse file with un-partioned space at the end of the
# disk.  In our tests, this doesn't occupy any more space/objects in the cluster
# but the rbd could be resized from within the rbd (VM) to grow.  Once you bring
# it up and are able to find the true size, you can resize with "rbd resize ..".
#
# To obtain needed utility input information if not already known run:
# rbd info RBD
#
# To find needed files we run the following command on all nodes that might have
# copies of the rbd objects:
# find /${CEPH} -type f -name rb.0.1032.5e69c215.*
# Then copy the files to a single location from all nodes.  If using btrfs be
# sure to pay attention to the btrfs snapshots that ceph takes on it's own.
# You may want the "current" or one of the "snaps".
#
# We are actually taking our own btrfs snapshots cluster osd wide at the same
# time with parallel ssh and then using "btrfs subvolume find-new" command to
# merge them all together for disaster recovery and also outside of ceph rbd
# versioning.
#
# Hopefully once the btrfs send/recv functionality is stable we can switch to it.
#
#
# This utility works for us but may not for you.  Always test with non-critical
# data first.
